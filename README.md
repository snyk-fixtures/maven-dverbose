Sample project containing pom.xml and the associated maven Dverbose graph.

The graph is generated by running ``.

To further inspect the Dverbose information on relations between dependencies, run commands:

- `mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose` - Displays the project's dependency tree in the console, including verbose details about omitted, duplicated, or conflicted dependencies.
- `mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose -DoutputType=dot --batch-mode --non-recursive` - Generates a DOT-formatted graph of the project's direct dependencies (non-recursive) with verbose details. The --batch-mode flag ensures non-interactive execution.
